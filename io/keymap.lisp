   "Associate functions with keys.

This defines a ‘keymap’ class which contains mappings of keys to actions.
The KEYMAP class has slots:
  map             - The the actual table of bindings, accessed by KEYMAP-MAP.
  default-binding - The binding that is invoked if the key doesn't match,
                    accessed by ‘keymap-default-binding’.

Keys are customarily a character or a keyword. Keywords are used to indicate
keys or events that aren't characters, like :F1 or :RESIZE.
Key bindings are customarily a function designator (so therefore a symbol or a
function), a list which represents function application, or another keymap,
where the next element in a key sequence is looked up.

Keymaps:
  macro DEFKEYMAP name (&key name default-binding) [docstring] alist
  function KEYMAP-P object -> boolean
  function SET-KEYMAP keymap alist -> keymap
  function MAP-KEYMAP function keymap -> NIL
  function ADD-KEYMAP source-keymap destination-keymap -> destination-keymap
  function COPY-KEYMAP keymap -> new-keymap
  function BUILD-ESCAPE-MAP keymap -> new-keymap
  function DESCRIBE-KEYMAP keymap &key (stream *standard-output*) prefix raw
    -> keymap

Key bindings:
  function DEFINE-KEY keymap key definition -> definition
  function SET-KEY keymap definition key-sequece -> definition
  function KEY-BINDING key keymap -> definition
  function KEY-DEFINITION key keymap-stack -> definition
  function KEYS-BOUND-TO definition keymap -> sequence
  function SUBSTITUTE-KEY-DEFINITION new-definition old-definition keymap
    -> keymap

Key sequences are sequences of keys that can trace a path through multiple
keymaps.

Key sequences:
  function KEY-SEQUENCE-BINDING key-sequence keymap -> definition
  function KEY-SEQUENCE-STRING key-sequence -> string
  function GET-KEY-SEQUENCE function keymap -> key-sequence OR key

Keymap stacks are sequences of keymaps that are searched in order for a key
definition.

Keymap stacks:
  macro PUSH-KEYMAP new current -> current
  macro REMOVE-KEYMAP new current -> current
