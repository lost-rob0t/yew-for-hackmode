  (:documentation "Shell style file name pattern matching.
Main functions are:
 fnmatch      - Checks whether a string matches a pattern.
 glob         - Returns a list of pathnames that match a pattern.
 pattern-p    - Returns true if the string might have pattern characters.
 expand-tilde - Returns the pathname with ~ home directories expanded.

The documentation for ‘fnmatch’ describes the pattern syntax a little.

  named classes:		[:digit:]  (e.g.: 1 2 3 １ ２ ３ 一 二 三)
  collating symbols:		[.splot.]   (presumably some locale thing???)
    maybe unicode, like: LATIN_SMALL_LETTER_A_WITH_ACUTE
NOTE:
  Can't be empty, so [] is invalid, []] matches a single ']'
  '-' as first or last character is not a range.
  '!' as first character is negation (¡¡¡ what about ^ !!!)
  POSIX doesn't support backslash '\' as an escape char, but other things do
