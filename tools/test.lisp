(defpackage :test
  (:documentation "Another crappy test framework.

Q: Hey! I just need to run some tests on my package! Like now!!
A: Okay. Here you go.

Q: How the heck do I use this thing?
A: Just say:
   (deftests group-name
     (form which is true if the test passed)
     (another such form)
     ...)

   (run-all-tests)

Q: What if a test fails? How do I know which one it was or what happened?
A: Say: (test:describe-test 'test-name). It will show you the code that failed.

Q: What if a bunch of tests fail?
A: Say (test:failed), to show all tests that failed.

Q: What if I need to set up pre-conditions for my tests?
A: You can use :setup and :takedown arguments to â€˜deftestsâ€™.

Q: Hey, but what if I'd like to add tests dynamically whilst I'm mucking
   about in the REPL?
A: Say:
     (test-in :your-package)
   then say:
     (test (some code that returns non-NIL if it succeeds))
   When you want to run the tests, say:
     (run-tests)
   When you're done, say:
     (save-tests)
   and it will append them to a file.
   You will probably have to edit the output to make it reasonable.
   Also, I never use this feature.

Q: What if I need to trap exceptions from my tests?
A: You can use the GOT-CONDITION macro in your test.

Q: What if I need to run just one test?
A: Use â€˜run-testâ€™.

Q: What do you have against providing cute test macros in the test bodies?
A: Nothing, execpt I think they're mostly pointless.

Q: What if I need to capture the output from my test?
A: You're on your own.

Q: What if I need to ...
A: Sorry, you're on your own!
   Why are you even using this instead of one of the 100s of others?

Q: Why did you write yet another test framework?
A: <no comment>
   (but probably the same reasons as everyone else)

Q: Are you at least going to write some documentation?
A: _This_ *is* the documentation.
